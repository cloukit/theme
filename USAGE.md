Extend `CloukitComponentTheme` and create your styles inside the constructor.

Then you can use your styles via the `CloukitThemeService` inside your components.

The theme component is usually hidden from the enduser. So do not care too much about it.

If you really want to create a custom style see the [Themeing Guide](https://cloukit.github.io/#/guide/themeing).
